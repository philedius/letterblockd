# Letterblockd

A Chrome extension for blocking Letterboxd users that you don't want to see reviews from. It removes content on the site by all people you add to your list in the options.

## Cool, how do I install it?
It's currently under review to be submitted to the Chrome webstore thing.

In the meantime you can run it yourself with these steps:

1.  Head on over to the [releases page](https://github.com/philedius/letterblockd/releases) and get the latest copy.
2. Extract it wherever you want.
2. Put `chrome://extensions` in the URL bar in Chrome.
3. Toggle the "Developer Mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder where you extracted the zip file.
7. Right-click the new extension icon and click options.
8. Follow the instructions on the options page.
9. Enjoy a better Letterboxd experience.
